# little-schemer-interpreter
This is a Scheme interpreter written by following chapter 10 of "The Little Schemer". It doesn't diverge far from what was in the book, except that I decided to add in support for some arithmetic operators and functions as primitives. Admittedly, I wrote things in the order that they appeared in the book, without too much regard for organization, so the large-scale structure of the code might be a bit messy. However, I think that much of the structure that resulted for this was good for readability; for instance, I decided to keep most "helper functions" like function-of, formals-of, etc. near the functions that used them, as this made it easier to see how the evaluator broke down expressions into their components. However, I left the functions for dealing with tables and entries at the top of the document instead of bringing them closer to the parts of the evaluator that used them (i.e. everything related to identifiers and applications of functions), as they're large functions and putting them in the middle of the evaluator code would have just cluttered it up.

This is still missing substantial parts of Scheme (e.g. define, if, booleans) and has quirks like arithmetic operators only accepting 2 arguments (which, in retrospect, I probably could have fixed by using something like fold). I might add those back in if I feel like it, and besides, when I read SICP I'll end up constructing a much more fully-featured evaluator.
